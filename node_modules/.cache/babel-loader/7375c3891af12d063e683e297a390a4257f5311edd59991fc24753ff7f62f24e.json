They include plants and other autotrophic organisms capable of photosynthesis. Through this process, they convert sunlight into chemical energy, primarily in the form of glucose.\\nConsumers: Consumers are organisms that rely on others for their energy needs. They are categorized into three groups:\\nHerbivores: These are primary consumers that feed on plants and plant materials.\\nCarnivores: These are secondary consumers that primarily prey on other animals.\\nOmnivores: These consumers have a more varied diet, feeding on both plants and animals.\\nDecomposers: Decomposers play a crucial role in recycling nutrients within an ecosystem.
